# UI and Design Direction

- Overall style is neo-brutalism web design.
- Use bold colors, strong contrast (black/yellow, purple/green, etc.), and large typography.
- Layouts are grid/card-based, with clear block separation.
- Allow playful, slightly experimental positioning or decorative elements.
- Avoid generic portal/blog look.
- GNB/navbar should also reflect the overall design, not minimalistic.
- For all components, prefer shadcn + Tailwind v4.1 utilities.

# Component Principles

- Use Radix UI primitives where needed for accessibility.
- Customize shadcn components to fit the neo-brutalism style.
- Allow for big heading fonts, visible borders, intentional shadow or no shadow at all.
- Input and button elements can have oversized padding, clear outlines, or accent colors.
- Cards can have flat or strong drop shadow, bold borders.
